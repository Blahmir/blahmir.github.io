## What is Gym Connect?

Gym Connect is a web-based concurrent fitness centre monitoring system. A **RTOS** built with **QNX Neutrino** to manage, maintain, and monitor a gym, all simplistically displayed in an interactive web-based UI. Monitoring systems such as temperature sensors within the **sauna, pool,** and even the **entire fitness centre**. Alongside a **weight sensitivity sensor** that triggers an alarm if weights to a certain degree make an impact or a **heart rate monitoring system** within cardio machines and even **gym-wide emergency alarms**. Gym Connects works to have staff aware of what and where anything is happening in **real-time**!

## Project Approach:

Creating an agile environment where tri-weely scrums were held to facilitate successful, progressive & continuous development of Gym Connect. Working in a three-sized team, members and I worked efficiently to complete the term project. Creating an interactive UI, gym management staff can seamlessly monitor all aspects of the gym whilst receiving push notifications of critical events.

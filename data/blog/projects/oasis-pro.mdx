## What is OASIS PRO?

The OASIS Pro is a cutting-edge, premium Cranio-Electro Stimulation (CES) gadget that stimulates the head with brief pulses of electricity. Through the application of modest electrical stimulus to the head, OASIS Pro encourages mental and physical healthiness. It can be used while sitting, lying down, or performing other calm, risk-free activities.
